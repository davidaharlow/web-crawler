## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

**Try to follow your own instructions.**

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Web-Crawler. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md); the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

When writing step-by-step instructions (e.g. how to install something), try to forget everything you know about the topic, and actually follow the instructions you wrote, a single step at time. Often you will discover that there is implicit knowledge that you forgot to mention, or that there are missing or out-of-order steps in the instructions. Bonus points for getting *somebody else* to follow the steps and watching what they struggle with. Often it would be something very simple that you have not anticipated.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Update to the latest version. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem,and if you can get the desired behavior by implementing your changes.

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/brycessorensen/web-crawler/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If you're reporting that Web-Crawler crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Web-Crawler) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Web-Crawler?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Web-Crawler from [the releases page](https://github.com/brycessorensen/web-crawler/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Web-Crawler are you using?** 
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**
* **Are you running Web-Crawler in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Are you using Web-Crawler with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Web-Crawler, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/brycessorensen/web-crawler/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Web-Crawler which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Web-Crawler users.
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**
